Adding a JSP to add flights, passengers, pilots and airplanes
I created a JSP called fancy_forms and linked it to a servlet called fancyforms. This servlet displays a form to input all the information
needed to add a flight, passengers, pilots and airplanes
I fixed a bug that stopped the Passengers list from displaying, i ket getting a 500 error.
I had set the return statement to null not pList so the page kept crashing. Sorted now.
